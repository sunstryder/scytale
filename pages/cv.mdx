## SUMMARY

<Callout>
I’m a conscientious and self driven developer looking to make strides in an engineering led company. Not only adept in React, I’m very comfortable with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS - fundamentals supported by formal degrees in Computer Science and Information Systems.

I’m confident in my ability to learn anything - my colleagues and managers have described me as a joy to work with, citing an attitude fertile for learning and curiosity that is self-driven and easily stoked by others. Having started as a tester, then spending months as a scrum master, I’m also respectfully aware of everybody’s role in building quality software.

The next steps in my career are to join a technology focused business filled with people just like me, but better. In doing so, I hope to develop my back end skills and gain holistic proficiency across the modern web stack.
